Abstract:
The data in this notebook is taken from the Berkeley Police Department Stop Data from October 2020 to May 2022. The goal of this project was to perform a simple analysis of the data to see what outcomes could be identified. Much of the data is focused on officer perception of identity, specifically race and gender which leaves much to be desired, especially concrete data which we can compare officer perception to identity to identify if certain identities are at risk of increased harrassment and exposure to the police.
